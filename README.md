# MSU Bootcamp Challenge 1: Horiseon

This is a README for the refraction of a Horiseon's website.  The aim of the refraction was to ensure that Horiseon had a "codebase that followed accessibility standards" so their website is "optimized for search engines."

*A descriptive title was added
*Semantic HTML tags were added where appropriate, including the following: header, nav, section, aside and footer.
*A broken link in the header was repaired
*ALT tags were added to each image
*HTML and CSS Styles condensed where appropriate for the content and benefits
*Comments were added to both the HTML and CSS files
